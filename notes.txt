cd build ; and cmake --check-system-vars

generator: cmake
CONAN_PKG:: takes care of other details like include paths, so we must add only in 1 place: TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES
enumerating COMPONENTS does not make very much a sense - its not used by CONAN_PKG::

Boost::unit_test_framework works like CONAN_PKG::boost (propagates proper include dirs) but links only one specified lib
Boost does not work, CONAN_PKG::boost must be used
